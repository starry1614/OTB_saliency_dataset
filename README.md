# OTB_saliency_dataset

We devise a new object-touching-boundary (OTB) saliency dataset comprising 1044 images that salient objects touch the image boundaries in each image. This dataset is specifically designed to evaluate the performance of salient object detection method on the scene that boundaries are adjacent to the salient objects.
